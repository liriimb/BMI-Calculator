# BMI-Calculator
This console application calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of weight (kg), height (cm), age, first name, and last name. It computes the BMI and categorizes the result (underweight, normal, overweight, obese). The project showcases basic C++ input/output and arithmetic operations.
